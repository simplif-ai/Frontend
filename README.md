# Frontend

## About
This folder contains the frontend for our application

### Environment setup

* Install yarn `npm install --global yarn`
* Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
* `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the webpack dev server

## Google Authentication

Simplif.ai uses Google's authentication API, which allows users to login to our application using their Google credentials.

We have followed the instructions for creating an application through the Google API console (found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/create-mysql-db/), which allows us to authenticate using the API.
