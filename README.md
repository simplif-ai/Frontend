## Google Authentication

Simplif.ai uses Google's authentication API, which allows users to login to our application using their Google credentials.

Credentials can be found [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=simplifai-181000).

We have followed the instructions for creating an application through the Google API console (found [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project/), which allows us to authenticate using the API.
